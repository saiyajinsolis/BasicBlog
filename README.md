Alright it took some time but after watching this video

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLmpKKaQL54

and following these instructions

*****************************************************************************************************

Configuring Git username/email

Open Command Line.

Set username:

git config --global user.name "First_Name Last_Name"

Set email address:

git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"

**************************************************************************************************

I was able to overcome my errors and apply an industry standard procedure to updatings
collaborative projects.

In the video the taught approach to commiting changes to a github repository involves first creatings
a seperate branch so as to avoid commiting changes directly to the main branch. Once you commmit and push the files you intend to have update your github repository with. Having commited and pushed them from a seperate branch you can now compare and review the new code to ensure its up to pare with the codes security standards and application goals.

Git Commit Protocol

New Branch -> Commit -> Push -> Compare -> Pull Request -> Merge
